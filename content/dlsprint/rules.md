## Rules and Regulations

1.  **Event details:**
    - Phase 1 Part 1: will be held in Kaggle from July 1st to August 24th. Participants are expected to build and train their model during this phase.
    - Phase 1 Part 2: will be held in Kaggle on August 25th. Participants will infer their model on a new dataset. The top 15 teams from this round will be selected for Phase 2.
    - Phase 2: will be held onsite at the Department of CSE, BUET, on September 2nd. Only invited participants can participate. Participants will infer their model on a new dataset and present their methods live in front of the judges’ panel. The address is *ECE Building, West Palashi, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka-1000, Bangladesh.*

2.  **Prize details:**
    - 1st Prize: 100K BDT
    - 2nd Prize: 60K BDT
    - 3rd Prize: 30K BDT
    - BUET rising team prize: 30K BDT. To qualify as a BUET rising team see Team guidelines.
    - Best Kaggle Notebooks prize pool: 30K BDT. Notebooks will be judged on number of **upvotes**, number of **forks** and **impact** on the competition. The winner must be able to attend the award ceremony in the Department of CSE, BUET to avail the prize.

3.  Only one account per participant in Kaggle will be allowed.

4.  Internet access should be disabled for any solution.

5.  All teams will submit working Kaggle notebooks for Train and Test with appropriate instructions for reproducibility after Phase 1 Part 1.

6.  Use of publicly available pretrained models are allowed and the participants must disclose the data used to pretrain the models. Furthermore, participants must directly use these models in their training, they cannot additionally pretrain their models in another dataset.

7.  The maximum number of submissions per day is 5 for Phase 1.


8.  **Team guidelines:**
    - Event registration is mandatory to participate in Phase 1 Part 2, and Phase 2 rounds.
    - The maximum team size is 4.
    - In a team, there can be a maximum of 2 people who have completed their undergrad.
    - For overseas participants, a minimum of 1 person should be present in Bangladesh during the Phase 2 round (to be held on July 29th) and prize-giving ceremony (tentative date one week after the final). If this team wins a prize, the whole prize money will be received by this member on behalf of the entire team.
    - A minimum of 75% of team members must belong to the **18/19/20 batch from BUET to qualify for the BUET rising team prize.**
    - Teams can merge only in Phase 1 Part 1. In the event of a team merger, team registration should be updated. The registration update link will be shared later.
    - No private code sharing outside teams.


9.  **Phase 1 Part 1 score is for benchmarking and validating participants' models and will also count towards the final evaluation score. The Phase 1 Part 2 and Phase 2 test datasets may contain samples with a slight domain shift (vocabulary) to encourage generalized models. A full evaluation will be based on the following factors (these are subject to change based on the organizers’ decision. Also, the weights of these factors will not be revealed to the participants):**
    - Phase 1 score
    - Phase 2 score
    - Reproducibility
    - Inference time
    - Model size
    - Explainability
    - Presentation

10.  **Competition Data:**
    - **DATA ACCESS AND USE:** Competition Use, Academic Use, and Non-Commercial Use.
    - **No external dataset** is allowed. Manual labeling of the test dataset is prohibited and will lead to disqualification.

12.  **Winner license:** The winner will grant the competition hosts and sponsors the following license:

*__You hereby license and will license your winning submission and the source code used to generate the submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code. For generally commercially available software that you used to generate the submission that is not owned by you but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding sentence for that software.__*
