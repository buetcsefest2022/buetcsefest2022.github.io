      - content: >-
          We will arrange a **two-day long** Hackathon which will have a **24-hour** coding sprint followed by presentation and judgment. The competition will have 3 segments - **DevOps, API and Web3**. Teams will have to participate **onsite**. It’s ideal to form teams with people having diverse skill sets which are necessary for that particular segment. The teams will be provided with the problem statement at the start of the onsite event. Teams will get help from mentors and problem setters throughout the event. The solution will mostly be a prototype and does not necessarily have to be a complete solution. **After the sprint is over the participants will give a presentation on the solution they developed to a panel of judges. The judging criteria will be provided to participants on the day of the event.**

          <br><br>

          Teams from universities from all over the country are eligible to participate in this competition. Even beginners with no prior experience are encouraged to participate as we will hold several workshops to give you an idea about the concepts and technologies of the segment you’re interested in.
